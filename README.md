# Pyspark Spam Filter
The Spam Filter project is developed using PySpark and MLlib, leveraging distributed data processing capabilities for efficient handling of large datasets. The core classification algorithm used is Naive Bayes, a probabilistic method known for its effectiveness in text classification tasks like spam filtering. The project includes extensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing steps to prepare and clean the text data, ensuring optimal performance of the spam filter model. By combining PySpark's distributed computing power, MLlib's machine learning algorithms, and advanced NLP techniques, the project aims to accurately identify and filter spam emails, contributing to improved email management and user experience.

## Data Source
